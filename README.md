A collaborative project to create an Android app for a general store. The project uses Firebase Database and
Authentication services. It was developed with Android Studio, written in Java, by two university students as part of a
graded project for a class

To Run the app your local.properties must include:

API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

The API key is for Google Maps, regrettably I do not remember any important set up instructions...
